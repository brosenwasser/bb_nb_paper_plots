##########################OBSERVATIONS AND SAMPLE SELECTION################################################
##############IMAGING#############
We have obtained Subaru imaging over a large, $\sim4$ deg$^2$ area centered on the COSMOS field (158.082, 2.373; J2000 coordinates in decimal degrees). These efforts are a part of an extensive search for strong emission line galaxies at redshifts z < 1 using Subaru’s capabilities. The broadband \textit{i’, z’,} and \textit{y’} data was obtained with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC; Miyazaki et al. 2012) in March 2014 and January 2015. The full field is made up of four individual fields and covers a square area with 2.1$^\circ$ on a side. Seeing conditions ranged from 0.75’’ in the \textit{z’} band and 1.2’’ in the \textit{y’} band, and the data was reduced with the HSC pipeline (http://hsca.ipmu.jp/public/pipeline/installation.html). The narrow-band observations were obtained with the Suprime-Cam in December 2014, with the NB921 filter (center, 9183A; FWHM, 132A.) The total area of the final narrow-band image is $\sim$ 3 deg$^2$ and was reduced with Subaru Data Reduction Cookbook (SDFRED2; Ouchi et al., 2004, ApJ, 611, 660). Seeing conditions for these data was roughly 0.9’’. These observations were presented by Hu et al. (2016), and we refer the reader to section 2 of that paper for a more detailed account of the data. 

##############SAMPLE SELECTION#############
We constructed two catalogs of spectroscopic targets using the broadband and narrowband images, respectively. The broadband excess targets were selected as having excess emission in the \textit{y’} band (9400 A -10600 A) relative to the average of the \textit{z’} (8600 A-9240 A) + J bands (central $\lambda$ 12500 A, 1800 FWHM). The J band data is from the UtlraVISTA survey (McCracken et al. 2012) and was not available over the entire field; when the data was not available the excess is relative to the \textit{z’} only. Excess in the \textit{y’} band picks out [OIII]/H$\beta$ emission from z $sim 0.8-1.1 galaxies and H$\alpha$ emission from z $\sim$ 0.4-0.6 galaxies. We also searched for excess in the \textit{z’} band relative to the \textit{i’}+\textit{y’} bands, which targets [OIII]/H$\beta$ emission down to z $\sim$ 0.7 and H$\alpha$ emission down to z $\sim$ 0.3. We considered a magnitude difference of ____ between the emission and continuum filters to be an excess. The narrowband excess sources were identified in the NB921 image down to a limiting AB magnitude of 24.25, which corresponds to a S/N > 5 $\sigma$. The total broadband and narrowband excess catalogues are summarized in table 1.

###############SPECTROSCOPY##########################
We obtained optical spectroscopy of a large portion of sample using the multi-object spectrograph Hydra on the 3.5 m WIYN telescope. We used the red fiber bundle that feed the bench spectrograph with a 316 line mm$^{-1}$ grating at blaze angle 7.0$^\circ$, yielding a spectral resolution of 2.6 $\Angstrom$ pixel$^{-1}$. We used the GG-420 filter to block light below 4000 $\Angstrom$ and obtained a total wavelength range of 4800 - 9500 $\Angstrom$, although the spectra are quite noisy below $\sim$ 5000 $\Angstrom$. We used the WHYDRA software to prepare fiber positioning configurations before each night 

The observations were performed over three observing runs in January, February, and March 2016. We used the WHYDRA software to prepare several fiber positioning configurations before each run. Each configuration could devote at most $\sim$ 60 fibers to science targets, while $\sim$30 were assigned to blank sky locations for an effective sky subtraction during the reduction process. Six fibers were designated for guide stars to lock the coordinates of the other fibers, although only three are required for this procedure. All integrations were done in 1200 s (20 min) exposures, and the total amount of exposures varied between each configuration. 

The first run was carried out on January 12, 14-16th, where we observed five different fiber configurations. The targets were primarily broadband excess sources, and the total exposures for each of the fiber setup are 3hr, 3hr, 3.33hr, 4hr, 3.67hr. The seeing for these nights was $\sim$ 1.5’’. The second run occurred from February 8-10th, where we completed observations of our broadband sample in 6 different configurations. The seeing was improved during these nights, $\sim$ 1.1’’. The total exposure times for the six configurations are 3.33hr, 2hr, 3.33hr, 3hr, 3.33hr, and 3.33hr. We observed the narrowband excess targets over our third observing run, from March 7th-9th. We lost the first night due to weather, and in the proceeding nights observed four configurations for 3hr, 2.33hr, 3hr, 3hr, respectively. The seeing on March 8th started at $\gt$1.5’’ but improved to $\sim$ 1.3’’ by the end of the night. The seeing was around 1.1’’ on March 9th. 

The WIYN spectra were reduced with IRAF. We first performed overscan, bias, and dark correction, and image trimming. Flat fielding was done with dome flats taken either at the beginning or the end of each configuration, depending on the time of night. The 1d spectra were generated by the Hydra package DOHYDRA (Valdes 1995) and wavelength calibrated with Cu-Ar lamp spectra that were taken for each individual fiber configuration. Finally, skylines were subtracted with a composite sky spectrum from the co-added blank sky fibers.

###########################################REDSHIFTS##############################################
############Identification############
The redshift of each object was measured by visual inspection of the spectra in the IRAF program splot. The identification was made using the strong emission lines of [OII] $\lambda$3727, [OIII] $\lambda$5007, and H$\alpha$, as well as H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, H$\delta$, [NeIII] $\lambda$3866, and in some cases [OIII] $\lambda$4363. All identifications were inspected by at least two authors independently, and we required at least two emission lines for each galaxy. We work under the philosophy that the redshift can either be measured or they cannot, so the redshifts of which there was only one identifiable emission line or were in any way questionable are left out of the analysis. Under this conservative approach, we can be confident that the quoted redshifts are secure.
